Daily more than 6.9 million commuters commutes using mumbai local train.

People buy tickets on counter, or use coupons and CVM .
Even there are fare charts at stations near ticket counter and CVM, Using this software one can know exact fare well in advance and we hope you will provide exact change.
This will help in saving precious time of your and other commuters,ticket issuing authority as you may start giving exact change.

Also due to space limitation many time rush on fare chart near CVM can be avoided.
